The code is a set of instructions for a computer to follow. It's a program that helps us make a website that can shorten long web addresses.

We use some special tools called express and mongodb to help us build the website.

The website has a special place where we can type in a long web address and it will give us a shorter web address. We can use the shorter web address to visit the same website as the long one.

The website is like a house and it has a door. When we knock on the door (visit the website), it says "hello" to us (shows us a message).

We can visit the website by going to our computer and typing in its address (http://localhost:3000).

We need to start the website so that other people can visit it. We do this by telling the computer to run the program.

When we visit the website, it will also remember the long and short web addresses that we type in. It will keep them in a special place called a "database".

That's it!
